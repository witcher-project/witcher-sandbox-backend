# **Welcome to Witcher 3 API!**

## **What is this ?**

This is an unofficial API that provides access to a large dataset of Witcher 3. With this API, you can fetch all sorts of items (Alchemy items, Craft Items, etc.), quests (Main, Secondary, Treasure Hunts, etc.), characters, books, locations, and much more!


## **How can I use it ?**

Like any other API, this provides the opportunity to build your own product around it. It could be a website devoted to the Witcher universe that allows people to create their own items and characters and share them with others, a mobile companion app that aids throughout the gameplay, or even be used for modifications to the game itself.


## **Motivation**

My passion for "The Witcher" series runs deep. I've devoted countless hours to exploring every corner of "The Witcher 3." Recently, in a shared adventure that began in December of 2023, I introduced my girlfriend to this captivating world. It was her first foray into the game, and together, we embarked on a journey unlike any other — she at the helm, with me by her side, offering guidance and support. She immersed herself in the game with passion, dedicating her vacation to uncovering its secrets. Together, we navigated nearly every quest, save for a few elusive ones like ["The Cave of Dreams"](https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Cave_of_Dreams) and those tied to Gwent. Over two months, she completed the game and its DLCs, investing over 200 hours into a world that captivated her as much as it did me.

Our experience was an emotional odyssey, filled with moments of joy, sadness, confusion, and empathy — a testament to the game's power to evoke a spectrum of feelings. A few years before, she had also delved into the books, which enriched our connection to the narrative even more. The culmination of our journey, particularly the poignant conclusion of the ["Blood and Wine"](https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Blood_and_Wine) DLC, where Geralt smiles knowingly at us, left a lasting impression. It felt like a farewell to a friend, a hero who had earned his peace in the serene Corvo Bianco, with the promise of visits from cherished companions.

This journey through "The Witcher 3" was more than just a game; it was a journey that brought us closer, filled with emotions. I feel driven to contribute to this magnificent world that has given us so much joy and so many memories.
